## Description

This project is a server-side calculator built using Javascript, jQuery, HTML, some CSS, and a Node Server. This project features a calculator where a user can input values â€” x and y using their browser and then select which operation to run (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). After doing some server-side calculations, the response is then rendered on the DOM as well as a history of the user's calculations.
