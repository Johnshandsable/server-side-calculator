[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

This project is a server-side calculator built using Javascript, jQuery, HTML, some CSS, and a Node Server. This project features a calculator where a user can input values â€” x and y and then select which operation to run (addition, subtraction, etc.). After doing some server-side calculations, the response is rendered on the DOM and displays a history of the user's calculations.

All issues are currently, as of 02/07/2021, not solved. Issues remaining are needing to validate user inputs, updating the UI, and adding features.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).

## Prerequisites

[Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/)

[jQuery] (https://jquery.com/)

## Installation

1. Run 'git clone url' to clone the repository to your machine
2. Open the 'server-side-calculator' folder in a text editor of your choice
3. Run the 'npm install' command on your terminal
4. Run the 'npm start' command on your terminal to launch the server
5. Open the browser and navigate to 'localhost:5000/'

## Usage

This application works like a standard calculator. Simply put in a value by clicking one of the numbers, then click an operation button ('+', '-', '/', '\*', etc.), and then input a second value. The calculator will keep history of the inputs as well, so you can see where you are in your calculations.
